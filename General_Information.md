# General information for participants

## For participating

Please, ensure that you filled in the form at https://forms.gle/Rr2QbfWZmigxvwFa7

We will use to get names, email addresses, institutions,
and other informatio about all participants.
It is not enough that somebody in a team fills in it: all participants
should fill it in as soon as possible, if they didn't already.

## Communication means

The main communication means for the hackathon are:

* Email. Please, ensure you filled in your email address in the form.
If so, you will receive some messages from the organization, and you will have
access to the email addresses of other participants, so that you can enter into
contact with them if needed. Please, use these addresses only for matters
related to the hackathon, except that the other party gave you explicit permission
for other communication.

* Matrix. Please, answer to the first email message you get from us with your
Matrix address. You will be added to a Matrix room where we will post some information,
and will be able of interacting with other participants and the organizers.
If you are not familiar with Matrix, you can just go to [Element.io](https://element.io/get-started)
and donwload the mobile app, or use the web version.

* Videochat. Unfortunately we cannot offer you an specific video channel for the
hackathon, but for meetings of a few people (usually less than 8), you can open a room
at [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/), which is free, and powered by free software.

* Training sessions. For training sessions we will use Teams, with specific links that will be shared
with participants in advance.

## Hacking days and solving issues

To be agreed in the Matrix room. They can include all participants and organizers, or only some participants.
At least we will have one hacking day per week until the presentations to the PC. In any case, we will try to
schedule as much as needed.

For issues related to the installation or deployment of the tools, or to problems with their basic usage,
the preferred way of interaction will be by opening tickets in the [GrimoireLab main repository](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab), and posting the corresponding link to the Matrix room, so that other participants and
organizers can join the conversarion, in addition to GrimoireLab developers.

For issues related to the hackathon itself, the preferred way of interaction will be by opening tickets
in this repositor, and and posting the corresponding link to the Matrix room, so that other participants and
organizers can easily join the conversarion.

* First session (2021-12-02 16:00 UTC) Checking session

## Hackathon teams

Participants are encouraged to form part of a team, although individual participation is also possible.
For describing a team, we will use the [teams.md file](teams.md). Please, pull request on it, by adding
a new team description, or by proposing changes to some team description. When done, post the link to the
pull request to the Matrix room, so that everyone gets informed.

Each hackathon team will have a name, a list of participants, and a link to their own repository.
Teams members are expected to collaborate in their repository in an open and public way, so that any 
participant or organizer can browse what teams are doing, and comment on their work by opening issues
in their repository, if needed. Discussions specific to the team, and its internal organization,
should be done as much as possible via issues, pull requests, and documentation in their repository,
so that all of it is open to other participants and organizers. Of course, teams are free to
use other communication channels for their organization, if they feel that is convenient.
In any case, their repository can be framed as the source for the reproduction package of their
research, so the more detail it includes, so that their research is easier to reproduced, the better.

## Presentations to the PC

The presentations to the PC are of ideas of each team's project.
Ideas (and the project itself) don't need to be complete at that moment, but the more detailed the better.
Presentations will be done via videoconference, based on slides,
and references to the repository of the team are welcome.

The main aim of presentations is to provide feedback, both from a research and from a practical point of view,
to the projects presented. The feedback will be provided by organizers and by the members of
the MSR Hackathon PC that can join.

There are two sessions to present to the PC. Participants are welcome to attend both of them, but they
will present in only one of them. The schedule of the sessions is:

* First session (2021-12-10 8:00 UTC). Presentations by Groninger Bugbusters, Team NAP, Team Hexa, Team Magna Carta Libertatum.

* Second session (2021-12-10 16:00 UTC). Presentations by Team Balloon, Team Pacers, Team MPR, Team OpenSSL, Team GrimoireGitter.

## Description of team projects

Each team is expected to submit a description of their project, along with the results they obtained.
This description will have the form of a two-pages paper, that can be complemented with as much
information as the team consider convenient, in their repository. Subimissions will be judged by the PC
based on the clarity of the description, the originality of the idea,
the potential impact of the proposed solution, and the sophistication of the artifacts produced during the hackathon.
